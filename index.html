    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I am a freelance web site designer/developer with hopes of adding phone and other device applications to my repertoire. 
        Currently graduated with an Associate of Applied Science from DeVry University. While figuring out what path catches all I want
        to do in a career. I am doing my best to relearn what I once knew, as well as learn new languages and more to full my want for knowledge.</p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am going back to the basics to learn more on web development and their foundations. Thanks to the friends/mentors that are 
        helping me achieve these feats. I am thankful each one of them has allowed me to learn from them and build upon skills. As well as maybe
        help me find where I belong in the IT world.</p>
