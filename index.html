          <p>
            I am a freelance web site designer/developer with hopes of adding
            phone and other device applications to my repertoire. Currently
            graduated with an Associate of Applied Science from DeVry
            University. While figuring out what path catches all I want to do in
            a career. I am doing my best to relearn what I once knew, as well as
            learn new languages and more to fuel my want for knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am going back to the basics to learn more on web
            development and their foundations. Thanks to the friends/mentors
            that are helping me achieve these feats. I am thankful each one of
            them has allowed me to learn from them and build upon skills. As
            well as maybe help me find where I belong in the IT world.

            I hope to have some mock up websites and apps in development soon!
            As well keep an eye out for a game collaboration that might pop up
            sometime soon.
